# OSA-Legacy-Collection
A collection of some previous versions of prototype and old ships, not supported but still useful, hosted for sake of history. These are free real estate for anyone to take.

Migo Mk2: Made before OSA, oversized and undergunned by modern meta standards.

Yith Mk2: Yith before the discovery of small plate meta, and before railguns came to live, is faster than the Mk3.

Xothian Mk1: Made when i thought circle fighting with railguns was a great idea (its not) it is over sized and slow, but it does fire 2 rails at high rate, has a old stagger system that can make the rails fire rapidly.

Byakhee Mk1: Ended up too slow for my tastes, not as fun as the Bowtie, Mk2 has been started again from scratch so the Mk1 goes here, still a good laser ship, has a large laser mag, thin, could be a good basis to make something new.

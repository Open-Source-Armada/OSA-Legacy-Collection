# OSA-Legacy-Collection
A collection of some previous versions of prototype and old ships, not supported but still useful, hosted for sake of history. These are free real estate for anyone to take.

Ghast Mk1: Smallest changed from Mk1 to Mk2, retied for clarity of versions.

Coleopteran Mk1: Started as a varient of the Ghast, became its own ship as of the Mk2.

Migo Mk2: Made before OSA, oversized and undergunned by modern meta standards.

Migo Mk3: Retired after development of Mk5, still a solid if old micro fighter.

Migo Mk4: In theme with unreleased fighters, Migo is too big and heavy, has greater power gen than Mk3 so it can shoot lasers effectivly, still a good base for a budding designer to rework.

Yugg Mk1: A solid 4 gun fighter that unfortunatelay got made redundent not by its own new Mk2, but by the Yith Mk4 beating it in weight and firepower, Yugg Mk2 soon.

Yith Mk2: Yith before the discovery of small plate meta, and before railguns came to live, is faster than the Mk3.

Yith Mk3: Yith after small plate meta, before tournements encouraged lighter ships.

Shoggoth Mk1: Became very sour with this design, its bulky in the wrong ways, replaced by Mk2 that is half the weight.

Xothian Mk1: Made when i thought circle fighting with railguns was a great idea (its not) it is over sized and slow, but it does fire 2 rails at high rate, has a old stagger system that can make the rails fire rapidly.

Byakhee Mk1: Ended up too slow for my tastes, not as fun as the Bowtie, Mk2 has been started again from scratch so the Mk1 goes here, still a good laser ship, has a large laser mag, thin, could be a good base to make something new.
